# Conflict of Interest Metrics

## Description
Concerns over the potential effects of industry funding and COI have been a recurrent feature in the study of the biomedical research enterprise and related clinical practice. Empowering researchers and policymakers with evidence-based approaches for the management of conflicts of interest (COI) in networks of research is essential for safeguarding the study of health and medicine and reducing the risk of negative effects on the practice of science and patients who rely on that science. In this context, the Conflict of Interest Metrics Project is devoted to developing evidence-based insights about the effects of COI on the biomedical research enterprise. Research projects presented on ConflictMetrics have been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the NSFâ€™s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), and the National Institutes of Health.
